# 👐 ASL Translator – Real-Time American Sign Language Letter Recognition

This project converts American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures into readable text in real time using 
computer vision and machine learning. It uses a webcam feed, detects hand landmarks, extracts features, and predicts the signed letter on-screen.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection  
- Recognizes ASL letters A–Z  
- Machine learning model trained on a custom dataset  
- Works with any webcam  
- Fast inference using a lightweight model  
- Built with Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Mediapipe  
- Scikit-Learn  
- NumPy  
- Joblib

## 📂 Project Structure

- collect_data.py – record ASL letter images  
- features.py – extract hand landmark features  
- train_model.py – train the ML model  
- realtime_predict.py – **main script** for real-time translation  
- hand_viewer.py – visualize hand landmarks  
- asl_letters_model.joblib – trained model file  
- output.txt – prediction logs  
- X.npy, y.npy and related files – saved dataset and splits

## ▶️ How to Run the Translator

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DhirChampaneri/asl-translator.git  
cd asl-translator  

### Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  

### Run the real-time translator:
python realtime_predict.py  

A webcam window will appear — perform ASL signs to see the predicted letters.

## 🧠 Model Training

To retrain the model or collect new data:

### Collect new data:
python collect_data.py  

### Train the model:
python train_model.py  

This generates a new asl_letters_model.joblib file.
